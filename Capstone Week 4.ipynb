Coffee shops in this data will be identified and another data set will be created by pulling Foursquare data for \u2018neighborhoods\u2019 defined by a 500-meter radius surrounding each coffee shop. The Foursquare venue category will be used to create a new category to classify each location. This new feature will be used in the data analysis."
